A guide to learn more about all the presidents of the United States


This application gives information on the United States presidents with a brief summary of each president. Simply click on the 'Learn More' tab under each president to learn more about them.

All the data from the presidents is stored in SQLite database and is called to the presidents page when the button is clicked.

Python version 3.12

The application uses Python, HTML and CSS in the Django web framework.

The static folder contains the images of all presidents. There is also a second css index in addition to the bootstrap template that was linked on the html page.

This project was intended for my daughter to answer her endless questions about the presidents and what they looked like :)
